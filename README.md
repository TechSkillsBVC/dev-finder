# dev finder

**dev finder** is a mobile app that helps developers find peers in a geographic area, fostering new projects, knowledge sharing and professional growth.

Because physical proximity between users is important for such collaboration, you are encouagaed to fork this project for your own local area, add your own branding, maybe translate it, and release it to the app stores. You will also have to have a backend service to connect your fork to, as instructed [below](#backend-setup).

## Installation

The app is not released in the app stores. If you want to run it, follow the [setup instructions for developers](#setup).
